As per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness, indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body, Man & Nature.<br> According to modern scientists, everything in the universe is just a manifestation of the same quantum firmament. One who experiences this oneness of existence is said to be in yoga, and is termed as a yogi, having attained to a state of freedom referred to as mukti, nirvana or moksha.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus the aim of Yoga is Self-realization, to overcome all kinds of sufferings leading to 'the state of liberation' (Moksha) or ‘freedom’ (Kaivalya).<br> Living with freedom in all walks of life, health and harmony shall be the main objectives of Yoga practice."Yoga” also refers to an inner science comprising of a variety of methods through which human beings can realize this union and achieve mastery over their destiny.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoga, being widely considered as an ‘immortal cultural outcome’ of Indus Saraswati Valley civilization – dating back to 2700 B.C., has proved itself catering to both material and spiritual upliftment of humanity.<br>Basic humane values are the very identity of Yoga Sadhana.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Yoga works on the level of one’s body, mind, emotion and energy.<br> This has given rise to four broad classifications of Yoga: karma yoga, where we utilize the body; bhakti yoga, where we utilize the emotions; gyana yoga, where we utilize the mind and intelect; and kriya yoga, where we utilize the energy.<br>
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>Each system of Yoga we practice would fall within the gamut of one or more of these categories.<br> Every individual is a unique combination of these four factors.<br> </p>
