# Health_assistant1
The project I shared, "Health Assistant," was completed during my Bachelor's degree in BCA. It's a PHP-based application that addresses real-life challenges related to emergency situations and quick access to medication. The main idea is to help users find nearby medical shops that might have the required medicine without the need to visit each shop physically. Initially, I planned to use the Google Nearby API, but due to cost considerations, I used dummy data instead.
